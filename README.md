# jrBlog Responsive WP Theme
============================


jrBlog is a responsive wordpress template built for personal usage, but also as a template designed to be used by DEVELOPERS to make it easier to create a responsive wordpress template. The template works out of the box, but can also be used as a base for future wordpress templates, which I will be using it for as well.

This template utilizes TwentyTwelve as a base, Twitter Bootstrap, and Less. The WP-Less Wordpress extension used in this template was created by Robert O'Rourke. As this template uses LESS instead of normal CSS, this stylesheet page is only here to represent the theme itself. All styles have been removed from this stylesheet.

All content areas that may potentially be editable are created as Widget Areas. Even the header can be made into a widget area if no header image is provided.


### WIP

At this point in time it is still work-in-progress. I can only do so much while working on other things. I'm going to try and make nightly updates from now on, even if its a couple of minor issues, but I can't guarantee a thing.

### TO DO
Things still to do:

1.) Add some SEO options. Primarily thinking of Google Code right now so I don't have to use an external plugin.

2.) Add Responsive Design. This is still something I need to research some more, and will be the final step to finishing this project.


## Update #7
Been a while, but I've been really busy. I added a fully functioning Socia Media Theme Options section for displaying Share links on the blog. I also fixed a number of bugs in the system, too, including some graphical bugs, and I've added Font Awesome to my LESS stylesheets.
